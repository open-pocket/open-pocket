# Open Pocket

## Background

[Pocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_(service)), previously known as Read It Later, is an application and web service for managing a reading list of articles and videos from the Internet.

In February 2017, Mozilla [acquired Pocket](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/27/mozilla-acquires-pocket/) and stated that Pocket "will become part of the Mozilla open source project".

A [ticket](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1343006) to open source the code was opened the same day, but closed in 2018.

It's now over four years since that promise, and although some code has been https://github.com/Pocket, the majority remans closed, including the core server and client applications.

There have been [continued requests](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/pocket-source-code/43686/7) for Mozilla to open source the code. The most recent public responses on this, from Pocket CEO [Matt Koidon](https://twitter.com/mkoidin?lang=en), were:

* https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/pocket-source-code/43686/7 (June 2020)
* https://github.com/Pocket/extension-save-to-pocket/issues/75 (July 2020)

The issues raised are valid. Open-sourcing a previously private codebase has many challenges.

## The Open Pocket Mission

Pocket is a great app and ecosystem, but its future success isn't guaranteed.

In 2020, Mozilla had [large lay-offs](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/). Although these didn't appear to impact Pocket, it does raise questions about Mozilla's financial health.

The purpose of the Open Pocket organization is to gather those who are interested in building a '[clean room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design)' open-source implementation of Pocket comprising of:
* A web site replicating the behavior of https://getpocket.com/
* An API compatible with the current ([v3](https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/v3/retrieve)) Pocket API.
* Clients such as an iOS and Android app

## How to Help

* Star and Watch this repo to follow the latest updates.
* If you have thoughts on how to help build Open Pocket, create an issue to help find others to work with.
* If you've already started building something, consider joining forces with the Open Pocket organization.

## Legal

* Any open source code should follow Pocket's [branding guidance](https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/branding).
* It is not yet known if Pocket/Mozilla hold any patents on Pocket behaviour.

## Background

Open Pocket was founded by [@andyw8](https://github.com/andyw8), a long-term fan of Pocket, and a Premium subscriber since 2014.
My favorite way to consume Pocket articles is with the Android app on a [Boyue Likebook](https://twitter.com/BoyueTechnology) e-reader.
I'm also one of the maintainers of the [pocket-ruby](https://github.com/turadg/pocket-ruby) API client.
For full transparency, I am also building a commercial product relating to Pocket (not yet released).
